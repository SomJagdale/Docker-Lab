Q1.attach
Q2.docker run vs docker container run
Q3.dockerfile has no replacement
Q3. for dockerfile repo

Now we are creating two container which will be by default part of the bridge network which default network driver
here we are using alpine container for easy demonstration

docker container run -itd --name alpinec1 alpine
docker container run -itd --name alpinec2 alpine

docker network ls
docker inspect bridge | less
docker container inspect alpinec1

docker container inspect --format={{}}

now we access the container and ping each other
now we are trying to ping by name of the container

here we cant
so we are creating user defined bridge network

to creat that we run below command 

docker network create --driver bridge ntr-net1
docker network inspect ntr-net1

docker run -itd --name alpinec1 --network ntr-net1
docker run -itd --name alpinec1 --network ntr-net1

now we can check that we can ping each other by using it's name also 

now we will show you how none work
 
Now we will show how host 

overlay works (docker swarn)

Creating Subnet 

docker network create ntr-net2 --subnet 192.168.100.0/24 --gatway 192.168.100.1

assign static IP address to the container
docker container run -itd --name alpinec3 --ip 192.168.100.20 alpine

port forwarding

docker container run -itd --name nginxc1 --port 1234:80 nginx
access the container and show them contain port 
by netstat -tunulp
show them host port of running host machin also
and type below in browser and check

https://10.10.19.178:1234
